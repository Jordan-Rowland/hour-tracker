        This app is based on the idea introduced by Josh Kaufman in his book, "The First 20 Hours".
        You might even think of this as a to-do list on steroids, a way of tracking tasks that will
        take up to 20 hours to complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you add a task, you can click on the task-name to mark an hour as
        completed. When the maximum amount of hours for a task is reached, the task will automatically
        be removed from your list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking on the hours block allows you to add or subtract several hours at once to make tracking
        progress easier.
